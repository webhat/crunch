            <p>So here I am with my face on a website, so you can see what I look like.</p>

            <p class="below">In our coaching relationship however, your willingness to have a honest look at yourself is
                a
                lot more important than who I am or what I can do. I am only a facilitator.</p>

            <p>To keep that clear I will coach you for a period of no longer than three months. And before we even get
                started, I want to know that you have a goal that is truly important to you. </p>

            <p class="below">Going after that goal creates all kinds of challenges around you and inside you, and that
                gives
                us something to talk about.</p>

            <p class="below">I combine several approaches to coaching and our coaching can and will take different
                levels.
                In short, our conversations may be:</p>

            <div class="conversations">
            <h4 class="conversation">Mindblowing</h4>
            <span>Unearthing, acknowledging and replacing the unnoticed assumptions that you have made about the world that
            you live in.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <h4 class="conversation">Engaging</h4>
            <span>Improving your ability to engage yourself and others in your vision, and to listen to theirs.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <h4 class="conversation">Practical</h4>
            <span>Mastering the practical art of developing new habits.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <h4 class="conversation">Confronting</h4>
            <span>Having an honest look at your results and asking feedback from important people in your life.</span>
